# AUTOMATIC AUTHOR RECOGNITION USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES

  This system is developed as a part of academic main project. This system can be used to predict the
authorship of an unknown document. You need to train the system before the prediction. Training means 
you need to give author names and some books of the author to the system. We got 80.95% output in overall 
testing and 92% result in Binary testing. A video demonstration of working can be seen in this 
<a href="https://youtu.be/uDNAPe6SDpc">Working video</a>.
  System is fully written in python. You need some extra python modules to make the system work. You
can find the detailed instructions to  install these modules under the 'Installation instructions' sub-
heading.
  You need to copy the 'SourceCode' folder to your linux system and use the below command to run the system

				user@system :~$ python 1.py

  You can find DataSet containing some author's documeents in a folder called DataSet.
  We used 'git' for the version control purpose. So you can access all of the source code history by make use
of the git command. 
  This Source code is free to use for study purpose only. Any commercial usage of this source code with out
the written permission from the authors is strictly illegal.
